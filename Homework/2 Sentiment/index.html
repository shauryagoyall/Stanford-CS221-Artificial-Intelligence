  Advice for this homework:
  <ol class="problem">
    <li>
      Words are simply strings separated by whitespace. Note that words which
      only differ in capitalization are considered separate (e.g.
      <i>great</i> and <i>Great</i> are considered different words).
    </li>
    <li>
      You might find some useful functions in <code>util.py</code>. Have a look
      around in there before you start coding.

  <div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: Building intuition</div>

  <p>
    Here are two reviews of <i>Perfect Blue</i>, from
    <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com">Rotten Tomatoes</a>:
  </p>

  <p>
    Rotten Tomatoes has classified these reviews as "positive" and "negative,"
    respectively, as indicated by the intact tomato on the top  and the
    splatter on the bottom. In this assignment, you will create a simple
    text classification system that can perform this task automatically. We'll warm up with the following set of four mini-reviews, each labeled
    positive $(+1)$ or negative $(-1)$:
    <ol>
      <li>$(-1)$ pretty bad</li>
      <li>$(+1)$ good plot</li>
      <li>$(-1)$ not good</li>
      <li>$(+1)$ pretty scenery</li>
    </ol>
    Each review $x$ is mapped onto a feature vector $\phi(x)$, which maps each
    word to the number of occurrences of that word in the review. For example,
    the first review maps to the (sparse) feature vector $\phi(x) =
    \{\text{pretty}:1, \text{bad}:1\}$. Recall the definition of the hinge loss:
    $$\text{Loss}_{\text{hinge}}(x, y, \mathbf{w}) = \max \{0, 1 - \mathbf{w}
    \cdot \phi(x) y\},$$ where $x$ is the review text, $y$ is the correct label,
    $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector.

      Suppose we run stochastic gradient descent once for each of the 4 samples

      \text{Loss}_{\text{hinge}}(x, y, \mathbf{w}).$$ After the updates, what

  <div class="problemTitle">Problem 4: Toxicity Classification and Maximum Group Loss</div>
<br>
Recall that models trained (in the standard way) to minimize the average loss can work well on average but poorly on certain groups,
and that we can mitigate this issue by minimizing the maximum group loss instead.
In this problem, we will compare the average loss and maximum group loss objectives
on a toy setting inspired by a problem with real-world toxicity classification models.
<br>
<br>
Toxicity classifiers are designed to assist in moderating online forums by predicting whether an online comment is toxic or not,
so that comments predicted to be toxic can be flagged for humans to review <a href="#fn-1">[1]</a>.
Unfortunately, such models have been observed to be biased: non-toxic comments mentioning demographic identities often get misclassified as toxic (e.g., “I am a [demographic identity]”) <a href="#fn-2">[2]</a>. These biases arise because toxic comments often mention and attack demographic identities, and as a result, models learn to <i>spuriously correlate</i> toxicity with the mention of these identities.
<br>
<br>
In this problem, we will study a toy setting that illustrates the spurious correlation problem:
The input $x$ is a comment (a string) made on an online forum;
the label $y \in \{-1,1\}$ is the toxicity of the comment ($y = 1$ is toxic, $y=-1$ is non-toxic);
$d \in \{0,1\}$ indicates if the text contains a word that refers to a demographic identity;
and $t \in \{0,1\}$ indicates whether the comment includes certain “toxic” words.
The comment $x$ is mapped onto the feature vector $\phi(x) = [1, d, t]$ where 1 is the bias term (the bias term is present to prevent the edge case $ \mathbf{w} \cdot \phi(x) = 0$ in the questions that follow). 
To make this concrete, we provide a few simple examples below, where we underline toxic words and words that refer to a demographic identity:

<br>
From the above table, we can see that 70 out of the 100 of toxic comments include toxic words, and 70 out of the 100 non-toxic comments do not. In addition, the toxicity of the comment $t$ is highly correlated with mentions of demographic  identities $d$ (because toxic comments tend to target them) &mdash; 90 out of the 100 toxic comments include mentions of demographic identities, and 90 out of the 100 non-toxic comments do not. 
<br>
<br>
We will consider linear classifiers of the form $f_{\mathbf{w}}(x) = \text{sign}(\mathbf{w} \cdot \phi(x))$, where $\phi(x)$ is defined above.
Normally, we would train classifiers to minimize either the average loss or the maximum group loss,
but for simplicity, we will compare two fixed classifiers (which might not minimize either objective):
<ul>
  <li>Classifier D: $\mathbf{w} = [-0.1, 1, 0]$</li>
  <li>Classifier T: $\mathbf{w} = [-0.1, 0, 1]$</li>
</ul>

For our loss function, we will be using the zero-one loss, so that the per-group loss is
$$\text{TrainLoss}_g(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_\text{train}(g)|}{\sum_{(x,y)\in\mathcal{D}_\text{train}(g)}}\mathbf{1}[f_\mathbf{w}(x)\neq y].$$
Recall the definition of the maximum group loss:
$$\text{TrainLoss}_\text{max}(\mathbf{w}) = \max_{g} \text{TrainLoss}_g(\mathbf{w}).$$
<br>
<br>

To capture the spurious correlation problem,
let us define groups based on the value of $(y, d)$.
There are thus four groups: $(y=1, d=1), (y=1, d=0), (y=-1, d=1)$, and $(y=-1, d=0)$.
For example, the group $(y=-1, d=1)$ refers to non-toxic comments with demographic mentions.

As we saw above, different classifiers lead to different numbers of accurate predictions and different people’s comments being wrongly rejected.
Accurate classification of a non-toxic comment is good for the commenter, but when no classifier has perfect accuracy, how should the correct classifications be distributed across commenters?  Here are four well-known principles of fair distribution:

<ol>

First, choose an objective (average loss or maximum group loss) by appealing to one of the four principles.
Which of Classifier D or Classifier T would you deploy on a real online social media platform in order to flag posts labeled as toxic for review? Refer to one of the above principles when justifying your answer.
      <div class="expected">
A 2-4 sentence explanation that justifies your choice of objective by referring to one of the four principles. There are many ways to answer this question well; a good answer explains the connection between a classifier and a principle clearly and concisely.

    We've talked about machine learning as the process of turning data into models, but where does the data come from?  In the context of collecting data for training a machine learning model for toxicity classification, who determines whether a comment <b>should</b> be marked as toxic or not is very important  (i.e., whether $y=1$ or $y=-1$ in the earlier data table). Here are some commonly used choices:
    <ul>
        <li>Recruit people on a crowdsourcing platform (like Amazon Mechanical Turk) to annotate each comment.</li>
        <li>Hire social scientists to establish criteria for toxicity and annotate each comment.</li>
        <li>Ask users of the platform to rate comments.</li>
        <li>Ask users of the platform to deliberate about and decide on community standards and criteria for toxicity, perhaps using a process of participatory design. <a href="#fn-7">[7]</a></li>
        </ul>
        Which methods(s) would you use to determine the toxicity of comments for use as data to use for training a toxicity classifier, and why? Explain why you chose your method(s) over the others listed.

      <div class="expected">

  <div class="problemTitle">Problem 5: K-means clustering</div>

  Suppose we have a feature extractor $\phi$ that produces 2-dimensional feature
  vectors, and a toy dataset $\mathcal D_\text{train} = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}$
  with
  <ol type="1">
    <li>$\phi(x_1) = [10, 0]$</li>
    <li>$\phi(x_2) = [30, 0]$</li>
    <li>$\phi(x_3) = [10, 20]$</li>
    <li>$\phi(x_4) = [20, 20]$</li>
  </ol>

  <ol class="problem">
    <li class="writeup" id="5a">
      Run 2-means on this dataset until convergence. Please show your work. What
      are the final cluster assignments $z$ and cluster centers $\mu$? Run this

      Implement the <code>kmeans</code> function. You should initialize your $k$
      cluster centers to random elements of <code>examples</code>. <br /><br />
      After a few iterations of k-means, your centers will be very dense
      vectors. In order for your code to run efficiently and to obtain full
      credit, you will need to precompute certain dot products. As a reference,
      our code runs in under a second on cardinal, on all test cases. You might
      find <code>generateClusteringExamples</code>

      If we scale all dimensions in our initial centroids and data points by
      some factor, are we guaranteed to retrieve the same clusters after running
      k-means (i.e. will the same data points belong to the same cluster before
      and after scaling)? What if we scale only certain dimensions? If your
      answer is yes, provide a short explanation; if not, give a counterexample.

There are many anti-discrimination principles.
